# Predict-Movie-Review-Sentiment-Keras-Word2vec
A dataset of movie reviews(2000) in form of documents is given for both postive(1000) and negaive(1000) ones. 
We will be spitting our dataset into train(1800) set and test(1800) set and train our keras model on the training 
data. We will be using word2vec to create the word embeddings and CNN is used for the purpose of Document Classification.
